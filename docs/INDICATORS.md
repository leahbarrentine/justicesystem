## Detection Methodology

The NLP system uses pattern matching, natural language processing, and contextual analysis to identify these indicators in:
- Hearing transcripts
- Trial transcripts
- Police reports
- Forensic reports
- Appeal documents
- Post-conviction filings

Each detected indicator includes:
- Confidence score (0-1)
- Exact citations with page/line numbers
- Quoted text
- Surrounding context
- Document type

## Scoring Logic

Priority scores combine:
1. Number of indicators (more = higher priority)
2. Severity levels (critical > high > medium > low)
3. Confidence scores
4. Indicator combinations (certain patterns boost score)
5. Category weights

Final scores range 0-100, with cases scored 75+ marked as urgent priority.
